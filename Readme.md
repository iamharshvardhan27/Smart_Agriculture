# Smart Agriculture Plant Health Monitoring using IoT 🌱

## Problem Statement 
Traditional agriculture faces significant challenges, such as inefficient resource management, unpredictable weather patterns. These problems lead to reduced productivity, higher operational costs, and increased environmental impact.

## Objective 
Our project aims to address these challenges using **IoT technology** to monitor environmental conditions in real-time, automate critical farming processes, and provide actionable insights to farmers, thereby improving productivity and sustainability.

## Solution Overview 
Our **IoT-based Smart Agriculture System** monitors key environmental parameters through connected sensors, providing real-time data to optimize crop management. The system also integrates multiple automations to streamline farming and environmental control based on sensor inputs. Additionally, the platform integrates with cloud solutions for data visualization and storage, enabling farmers to remotely access field data and take timely action.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 
  Sensors gather environmental data such as Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Light Intensity, Water TDS, Rain Sensing, Water Flow Rate, Biogas etc. which are transmitted to the cloud for live monitoring via a mobile or web interface.
  
- **Automation**: 
  The system automates critical tasks such as irrigation by responding to real-time data from sensors. For example, if soil moisture drops below a predefined level, the system automatically irrigates the field to maintain optimal growing conditions.
  
- **Cloud Integration & Data Visualization**: 
  The sensor data is uploaded to the cloud where it is visualized in a user-friendly dashboard. Farmers can track crop conditions, visualize trends, and receive critical alerts on potential issues like drought or temperature spikes.

- **Long-Term Data Storage**: 
  The platform stores historical data, allowing farmers to analyze trends over time and make data-driven decisions about crop management, resource allocation, and predictive analysis for future farming cycles.

- **Alerts & Notifications**: 
  Farmers receive alerts via the mobile app or web dashboard when sensor data detects any potential threats, such as abnormal temperature or soil moisture levels.
